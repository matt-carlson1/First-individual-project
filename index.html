    <h2>About me:</h2>
      <p>Currently I am in door to door sales. I work for a company called Caliber that is based out of Utah. I grew up in Tigard, Oregon and moved to Meridian, Idaho in 2017 when I graduated from the University of Oregon. I have also lived in Arizona for two winters and Indiana for a summer when I was managing a sales team.  </p>
    <h2>Background experience:</h2>
    <h2>Current interests, hobbies, and Skills:</h2>
      <p>I am really big into bodybuilding and physical fitness in general. I have been lifing weights since I was 18 years old so it's been a passion of mine for about 10 years now. I did a bodybuilding competition back in 2019 where I placed 5th place. I also spend a lot of time learning about proper nutrition and ways to maximize longevity. I enjoy hiking often and playing basically any sport. Recently I have been playing a lot of pickleball and volleyball. I also spend about 30-45 minutes each day reading. The books I read vary from nutrition to self help to learning about being efficient with finances. I enjoy traveling as well. I've been to four countries outside of the United States and will continue to grow that number over the years. Europe is next on my list.</p>

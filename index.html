      <p>
        Currently I am in door to door sales. I work for a company called
        Caliber that is based out of Utah. I grew up in Tigard, Oregon and moved
        to Meridian, Idaho in 2017 when I graduated from the University of
        Oregon. I have also lived in Arizona for two winters and Indiana for a
        summer when I was managing a sales team. I am able to work well both in
        a <span class="important">team environment</span> as well as on my
        <span class="important">own</span>. I am self-desciplined in many
        aspects of my life including my job and my health. I have great
        communication skills with being in door to door sales for over four
        years.

      <h2 class="oblique-center">Background:</h2>
      <p>
        I have been in sales for four years and have thought about getting into
        software engineering for about a year. I have multiple friends that took
        the <span class="important">Epicodus</span> program and got a job
        shortly after completing it. They all love what they do and have talked
        to me about the pros and cons of the industry. It intrigued me to check
        it out so I am taking the six week introductory program currently.
        Coding is such a unique skill and I have been enjoying it so far.

      <h2 class="oblique-center">Current interests, hobbies, and skills:</h2>
      <p>
        I am really big into <span class="important">bodybuilding</span> and
        <span class="important">physical fitness in general</span>. I have been
        lifing weights since I was 18 years old so it's been a passion of mine
        for about 10 years now. I did a bodybuilding competition back in 2019
        where I placed 5th place. I also spend a lot of time learning about
        proper nutrition and ways to maximize longevity. I enjoy hiking often
        and playing basically any sport. Recently I have been playing a lot of
        pickleball and volleyball. I also spend about 30-45 minutes each day
        reading. The books I read vary from nutrition to self help to learning
        about being efficient with finances. I enjoy traveling as well. I've
        been to four countries outside of the United States and will continue to
        grow that number over the years. Europe is next on my list.

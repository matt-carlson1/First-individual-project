    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>
      Currently I am in door to door sales. I work for a company called Caliber
      that is based out of Utah. I grew up in Tigard, Oregon and moved to
      Meridian, Idaho in 2017 when I graduated from the University of Oregon. I
      have also lived in Arizona for two winters and Indiana for a summer when I
      was managing a sales team. I am able to work well both in a team
      environment as well as on my own. I am self-desciplined in many aspects of
      my life including my job and my health. I have great communication skills
      with being in door to door sales for over four years.

    <h2>Background:</h2>
    <p>
      I have been in sales for four years and have thought about getting into
      software

    <h2>Current interests, hobbies, and skills:</h2>
    <p>
      I am really big into bodybuilding and physical fitness in general. I have
      been lifing weights since I was 18 years old so it's been a passion of
      mine for about 10 years now. I did a bodybuilding competition back in 2019
      where I placed 5th place. I also spend a lot of time learning about proper
      nutrition and ways to maximize longevity. I enjoy hiking often and playing
      basically any sport. Recently I have been playing a lot of pickleball and
      volleyball. I also spend about 30-45 minutes each day reading. The books I
      read vary from nutrition to self help to learning about being efficient
      with finances. I enjoy traveling as well. I've been to four countries
      outside of the United States and will continue to grow that number over
      the years. Europe is next on my list.
